NV-CONTROL X Extension Samples

The `nvidia-settings` application is fairly involved, and is not
the easiest source code to read through for someone interested in
learning how to use the NV-CONTROL.

The applications in this directory are trivial examples demonstrating
how to use the NV-CONTROL X extension.  For more thorough
documentation on the extension, please see the NV-CONTROL-API.txt
document (located in the doc/ directory of the nvidia-settings
source package).

Sample applications:

    nv-control-info: demonstrates how to query for extension
                     presense, basic information.

    nv-control-dvc:  demonstrates how to query and assign an
                     integer attribute (NV_CTRL_DIGITAL_VIBRANCE); also
                     shows how to handle multiple display devices.

    nv-control-events: demonstrates how to register to receive and
                     interpret NV-CONTROL events.


    nv-ddcci-client: demonstrates how to use the implementation of the 
                     DDC/CI interface with the NV-CONTROL X extension.
