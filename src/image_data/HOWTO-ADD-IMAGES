If I have a png, how do I build it into nvidia-settings?

    - Open the file in gimp:
    - make sure the image is in RGB mode (check IMAGE-> Mode -> RGB)
    - select the filetype as C-Source, and name the file <something>.h
    - click OK, on the subsequent option page, select the following:

        [ ] Save Comment to File
        [*] Use Glib Types (guint8*)
        [ ] Use Macros instead of Struct
        [*] use 1 Byte Run-Length-Encoding
        [ ] Save alpha Channel (RGBA/RGB)

        Opacity: 100.0
 
    - modify the header file, removing the struct declaration,
      following the convention in other header files, like
      big_banner_penguin.h.
